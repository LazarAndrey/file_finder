## My little python project.

Search for files(*txt, *dcox, *xlsx, *pdf, *json, *csv) by content(keyword) in the selected directory.    
The program was developed for Windows 10 x64.    
For GUI I used PyQt5.   
*2022/07/27 (Y/M/D)*:   
Excel file parsing not working.    
*In future:*   
Remake the program multi-threaded.
